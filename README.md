# Coding Challenge: Mitosis Simulator

**All files/code used in this strand and a screenshot of the outcome are in this repository.**

**Group Members: Anees, Carter, Tim, Cooper**

Our coding challenge was Mitosis Simulator. The Java Mitosis Simulator file in this repository contains documented code explaining what each line does, and how the program works. In addition, we presented on January 24th, a live explanation, which we feel will suffice.
